# Predicting Text Readability from Scrolling Interactions

Dataset containing scroll interactions of 598 partcipants reading advanced and elementary texts from the [OneStopEnglish corpus](https://github.com/nishkalavallabhi/OneStopEnglishCorpus). Participants answer multiple choice reading comprehension questions from [OneStopQA](https://github.com/berzak/onestop-qa). Study details and preliminary experiments can be found in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06354).
